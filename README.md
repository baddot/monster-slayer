# Monster Slayer
![screenshot](https://github.com/krystalcampioni/monster-slayer/blob/master/screenshot_.jpg?raw=true)

> A little Vue.js game prototype. The idea of this project was to expand on the Monster Slayer project created by Maximilian SchwarzmÃ¼ller on his [VueJs2 The Complete Guide Course ](http://www.udemy.com/vuejs-2-the-complete-guide), and see how further we could push the limits of the interface using Vue components, transitions and CSS animations.

> I presented a talk about this game and how to create interactive and animated interfaces with VueJS on the Code Talks Commerce 2018 in Berlin. You can find the slides here: https://krystalcampioni.github.io/monster-slayer
